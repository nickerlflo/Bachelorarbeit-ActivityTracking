Rapid technological change requires companies such as RZL Software GmbH to continuously adapt, presenting them with strategic and technical challenges. Migrating older software systems usually requires enormous resources. In terms of efficiency, a selective choice of functionalities based on pseudonymised user data can lead to significant improvements. Furthermore, established processes can be identified, maintained and optimised by users.\\
\\
While standard solutions for this problem already exist on the web, this is not the case for complex Windows Forms and WPF rich client applications. This thesis therefore focuses on the development of an activity tracking framework that can be used as flexibly as possible for WPF and Windows Forms applications. This framework should make it possible to send behavioural data to the company without making any major changes to the existing system and without impairing the use of the programme.\\
\\
The thesis begins with a comparison of different technologies. The system design is then created based on these fundamentals. The system is then implemented using C\# and integrated into a WPF and a Windows Forms application for testing purposes. To demonstrate its functionality, a configuration is created and the relevant data is determined from the existing system. This data also forms the basis for answering the questions that have arisen as a result of the optimisation problem.
